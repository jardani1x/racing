# Ordered ticket set

Derived from `Docs/16-InitialBacklog.md` on 2026-08-10. Format follows
`Docs/12-TicketTemplate.md`. Gates refer to `Docs/07-QualityGates.md`.

Every ticket runs the mandatory protocol from `CLAUDE.md`: implement with the
named specialist, then `code-reviewer` (read-only), then `test-engineer`
(read-only), maximum three repair cycles, then a blocker report. **No agent
reviews or tests its own change.**

### ENV-004 — acceptance criteria, closed 2026-08-10

- [x] `RunUAT BuildCookRun` produces a staged, paked, archived Win64 Development build; archive path recorded. **Caveat lifted 2026-08-12:** BLOCKER-006 is resolved by `-stagingdirectory` outside `Documents\`; the clean-stage path now succeeds and `-nocleanstage` has been removed from the canonical command.
- [x] Automation test command runs and reports pass/fail counts; log path recorded. 426/426 engine Smoke tests at close; **427/427 as of 2026-08-12**, the extra one being `RacingSim.Core.LogCategories` from `CORE-001`.
- [x] Packaged build launches with Pixel Streaming 2 arguments; flag names derived from the PS2 CVar-to-arg transform in source. Streamer connected, joined, published video and audio tracks, and survived a signalling restart.
- [x] Signalling server starts under node v24.18.0 at the pinned PSI commit. ASSUMPTION-001 resolved — **and corrected**: upstream *does* pin a version (`NODE_VERSION` = `v22.14.0`); v24.18.0 works but is two majors ahead.
- [x] Every verified command pasted into `Docs/Environment.md`; failures recorded as blockers (BLOCKER-006) and notes (NOTE-002).

Not covered by ENV-004 and still open: no browser client has connected, so no frame has
reached a viewer — that is `STREAM-001`. TURN is untested (`STREAM-004`, blocked). The
SFU cannot run until `mediasoup`'s skipped postinstall is approved.

### ENV-005 — acceptance criteria, closed 2026-08-10

- [x] `ModelContextProtocol` + `AllToolsets` enabled; editor started with `-ModelContextProtocolStartServer` (the server does **not** auto-start; `bAutoStartServer` defaults false).
- [x] `ModelContextProtocol.GenerateClientConfig ClaudeCode` run; `.mcp.json` inspected; `git check-ignore` confirms `.gitignore:52`.
- [x] Listener bound to `127.0.0.1:8000` — single row, no `0.0.0.0`, no `::`.
- [x] Connection attempts to all seven non-loopback IPv4 addresses refused.
- [x] Read-only discovery succeeded (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `list_toolsets`); **no write tool invoked**.
- [x] Packaged Game target contains neither plugin (evidence under ENV-003).

Carried forward: the loopback binding comes from the engine `HTTPServer` default
(`BindAddress = "localhost"`), which an `[HTTPServer.Listeners]` ini entry can silently
override. **SEC-001 must assert that section stays absent.**

**Standing hazard:** every path on this machine contains a space (`Program Files`,
`jun yi`). This has already produced two silent failures — `'C:\Program' is not
recognized`, and a `-project=` argument split at `C:\Users\jun` that surfaced as a
bogus JSON parse error. Quote every path; verify by reading logs, never exit codes.

### B-1 — Gate G plugin-exclusion evidence was wrong, corrected 2026-08-12

Raised by `code-reviewer` in the M0 verification pass. `Docs/Environment.md:197-212`
claimed a search of the packaged tree returned "zero matches" for six editor-only
plugins. That is false for two of them. The artifact shows:

- `Packaged/Windows/Manifest_UFSFiles_Win64.txt` lists `PythonScriptPlugin.uplugin`,
  `EditorScriptingUtilities.uplugin` and `DefaultEditorScriptingUtilities.ini`;
- `Packaged/Windows/RacingSim/Saved/Logs/RacingSim.log` records
  `Mounting Engine plugin EditorScriptingUtilities` and
  `Mounting Engine plugin PythonScriptPlugin`;
- `global.ucas` carries the cooked script-object names `/Script/ModelContextProtocol`
  (47), `/Script/ToolsetRegistry` (10), `/Script/PythonScriptPlugin` (5),
  `/Script/EditorScriptingUtilities` (3).

Cause: `FPluginReferenceDescriptor::IsEnabledForTarget`
(`PluginReferenceDescriptor.cpp:64-85`) is evaluated **per reference**, applied at
`PluginManager.cpp:2425`. The `.uproject` `TargetAllowList` suppresses only the
project's own reference; other enabled engine plugins reference `PythonScriptPlugin`
and `EditorScriptingUtilities` with no allowlist and re-enable them.

**What still holds:** `ModelContextProtocol`, `AllToolsets` and `ToolsetRegistry` are
genuinely absent as descriptors, binaries and mounts. The MCP exclusion is real. Only
the blanket "zero matches" sentence, and the "In shipping: No" column for those two
engine plugins, were wrong.

**Root cause established 2026-08-12, and there is no project-level fix.** The engine
plugins that re-enable the two, filtered to `"EnabledByDefault": true`, are `Bridge`,
`PluginUtils`, `ChaosEditor`, `Fab`, **`Niagara`**, `MetaHumanSDK`, **`PCG`**,
**`RigVM`** and `InterchangeTests`. Niagara, PCG and RigVM are core plugins this project
will need. Suppressing the leak means disabling them, which is not an option. This is
stock UE 5.8.1 behaviour; `RacingSim.uproject`'s `TargetAllowList` entries are correct
and cannot suppress a reference declared by another enabled plugin. **`SEC-001` and Gate
G must assert the narrow, true property** — that `ModelContextProtocol`, `AllToolsets`
and `ToolsetRegistry` are absent — not a blanket "no editor-only plugins are staged",
which is unachievable on a stock engine install.

**Consequence nobody had recorded:** because editor plugins load in the cook
commandlet, *which editor plugins are enabled changes the shipped bytes*. Disabling
`AllToolsets` later will alter `global.ucas`. This belongs in the rollback notes for
any decision to narrow the MCP toolset surface.

**Untested:** no Shipping-configuration build has ever been produced. The exclusion is
confirmed for Game/Development only; `Docs/07-QualityGates.md:9` says "shipping", and
that word remains untested. Gating is on `EBuildTargetType` and orthogonal to
`EBuildConfiguration`, so the inference is strong — but it is an inference.

## Epic 1 — project skeleton

| ID | Title | Owner | Depends on | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CORE-001 | Module/folder structure and logging categories | director | ENV-004 | A | **DONE** 2026-08-12 — `code-reviewer` approved at `9a7d5d4` after two blockers were closed. Ticket-level DONE only; **not** M0 sign-off |
| CORE-002 | Settings, build ID, units, telemetry contracts | race-systems-engineer | CORE-001 | A, B | **DONE** 2026-08-13 — `code-reviewer` approved across two passes at `f84300c`; `test-engineer` independently confirmed both targets build clean and 432/432 automation Smoke tests pass. Merged to `main` at `358848b`. Two MEDIUM findings (build-ID authority/sanitisation edge cases) tracked forward into `CORE-003` |
| TEST-001 | Test module and first smoke test | test-engineer + implementer | CORE-001 | A | OPEN |
| CORE-003 | DataAsset validation framework | race-systems-engineer | CORE-002 | A | OPEN |

**CORE-001 is the next ticket on the critical path**, gated only on the M0 signature
(`Docs/Reports/M0-DecisionSheet.md`).

### CORE-001 — acceptance criteria

Module granularity was contradictory between `Docs/15-ProjectStructure.md` and this
file (finding N-2, `code-reviewer` 2026-08-12). **Resolved 2026-08-12 by the project
owner: two modules.**

- [x] `Source/RacingSim/` remains a single `Runtime` module and gains the folders
      `Core/`, `Vehicle/`, `Race/`, `UI/`, `Streaming/`. Folders only — these five are
      **not** separate modules.
- [x] A new `Source/RacingSimTests/` module is added, typed **`UncookedOnly`**, with
      its own `RacingSimTests.Build.cs`. It must not appear in a packaged Game target.
- [x] `RacingSim.uproject` `Modules` array lists both modules with correct types.
- [x] `Source/RacingSim.Target.cs` and `Source/RacingSimEditor.Target.cs` add the
      modules each target needs. The Game target must **not** pull `RacingSimTests`.
- [x] `IMPLEMENT_PRIMARY_GAME_MODULE` stays in exactly one module
      (`Source/RacingSim/RacingSim.cpp:6`); `RacingSimTests` uses `IMPLEMENT_MODULE`.
- [x] One declared logging category per layer, and one for the test module.
      `LogRacingCore`/`Vehicle`/`Race`/`UI`/`Streaming` in
      `Source/RacingSim/Core/RacingSimLog.h`, plus `LogRacingTests` in
      `Source/RacingSimTests/RacingSimTestsLog.h`. Asserted by
      `RacingSim.Core.LogCategories`, including distinctness and non-collision.
- [x] Editor builds with **zero new warnings** — `Result: Succeeded`, output filtered on
      `warning|error` matched nothing, confirmed in
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\UnrealBuildTool\Log.txt`.
      **Game target: `ExitCode=0` from `BuildCookRun`; warning count NOT separately
      verified.** The original wording claimed zero warnings for both targets on the
      strength of an exit code, which `BuildCookRun` returns with warnings present.
      Narrowed to what was measured after `code-reviewer` flagged it — the same shape as
      the false Gate G "zero matches" claim corrected earlier this session. Filtered
      Game-target warning output is owed at `TEST-001`.
- [x] **Verification that the test module does not ship** — see the evidence block below.

### CORE-001 — verification evidence, 2026-08-12

**Two real defects were found by building, neither visible by inspection:**

1. `fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'Core/RacingSimLog.h'`.
   `DefaultBuildSettings = V7` sets `bLegacyPublicIncludePaths = false`, so UBT does not
   put the module root on the include path — only a `Public/` folder, which this module
   deliberately does not have. `RacingSim.h` had resolved only because it sits at the
   module root. Fixed with `PublicIncludePaths.Add(ModuleDirectory)` rather than
   restructuring into `Public/`+`Private/`, which preserves the agreed flat layer layout.
2. `LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "LogRacingCore"` ×5, in `RacingSimTests`.
   `DECLARE_LOG_CATEGORY_EXTERN` emits a plain `extern`, which does not cross a DLL
   boundary. Fixed with `RACINGSIM_API`, matching
   `CORE_API DECLARE_LOG_CATEGORY_EXTERN(LogHAL, Log, All)` in `CoreGlobals.h`.
   **This link error is the module split proving itself** — it is compile-time evidence
   that `RacingSimTests` is a genuinely separate binary.

**Test:** `RacingSim.Core.LogCategories` — 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 notRun.
Report `Saved/Automation/CoreReport/index.json`.

**Artifact check.** A Development Game target is **monolithic**, so modules link into
`RacingSim.exe` rather than shipping as DLLs. Manifest absence alone therefore proves
nothing, and the binary itself was searched in both ASCII and UTF-16. The check carries
its own positive control: the five runtime categories are found, so a null result means
absence rather than a broken search.

| symbol | in `RacingSim.exe` | expected |
|---|---|---|
| `RacingSim.Core.LogCategories` | absent | absent |
| `FRacingSimLogCategoriesTest` | absent | absent |
| `RacingSimTests` | absent | absent |
| `LogRacingTests` | absent | absent |
| `LogRacingCore` … `LogRacingStreaming` | **present** (UTF-16) | present |

`RacingSimTests` is also absent from all three staging manifests. `UncookedOnly` holds
even in a monolithic target.

**Path precision, per `code-reviewer` N-4.** Two files are named `RacingSim.exe`.
`Packaged/Windows/RacingSim.exe` (171,520 bytes) is the **bootstrap launcher** and
contains none of the needles — including the positive controls, so a check run there
returns all-absent and looks like a pass. The binary that matters is
`Packaged/Windows/RacingSim/Binaries/Win64/RacingSim.exe` (354,528,256 bytes). Always
cite the full path, and always keep the positive control.

**Stronger gate available, adopt at `TEST-001`:** `Binaries/Win64/RacingSim.target`
contains **0** occurrences of `RacingSimTests` while `RacingSimEditor.target` contains
**2**. That is UnrealBuildTool stating what it compiled, which beats string presence.

**Mechanism, verified in engine source rather than assumed.**
`ModuleDescriptor.cs:792-793` — `case ModuleHostType.UncookedOnly: return
!bBuildRequiresCookedData;` and `TargetRules.cs:1190-1195` —
`bBuildRequiresCookedData => bBuildRequiresCookedDataOverride ?? (Type == Game ||
Client || Server)`. The exclusion keys off `bBuildRequiresCookedData`, **not**
`TargetType` directly, and that is a settable override. So the guarantee rests on two
one-line invariants that nothing enforces: nobody sets
`bBuildRequiresCookedDataOverride = false` on a Game target, and nobody adds
`RacingSimTests` to `RacingSim.Target.cs`. Both hold today.

### CORE-001 — review findings assigned to later tickets

Raised by `code-reviewer` at `3bbd9ca`. Assignment is required before CORE-001 closes;
closure is not.

| # | Finding | Ticket |
|---|---|---|
| N-1 | `Source/RacingSim/Core/RacingSimLog.h:16-18` — the logging-policy comment is **wrong**. It names the second macro parameter as the compile-time strip; the strip tests the **third** (`CompileTimeVerbosity`), which is `All` here, so **nothing is compiled out in any configuration**. Only `NO_LOGGING` removes these, and it would strip `Log` too. Set `CompileTimeVerbosity` deliberately and correct the comment | `CORE-002` |
| N-2 | "test code physically cannot ship" is true only of code **in that module**. `WITH_DEV_AUTOMATION_TESTS` is 1 in a Development Game target, so an `IMPLEMENT_SIMPLE_AUTOMATION_TEST` written inside `Source/RacingSim/` compiles into the shipped exe and the CORE-001 gate would not see it. Add a rule that automation tests live only in `RacingSimTests` | `TEST-001` |
| N-3 | "splitting into modules later is a mechanical change" is true **only until the first `UObject` exists**. UObject paths are `/Script/<Module>.<Class>`, so moving a UClass breaks every Blueprint, DataAsset and map reference without authored `CoreRedirects`. Record that cost and make the granularity decision final before the first UObject ships | `CORE-002` |
| N-4 | Adopt the `.target` receipt check as the primary non-shipping gate; keep the string search as corroboration. Also cover **test content** — `Content/Tests/Maps/` cooks into the pak, which neither current check inspects. Needs `DirectoriesToNeverCook` plus a pak-side check | `TEST-001` |
| N-6 | `Docs/15-ProjectStructure.md` test-module tree omits `Core/`, which the implementation added | `CORE-002` |
| N-7 | `.gitignore` — the `Samples/` comment block visually captures unrelated `Archive/` and `StagedBuilds/` entries | `CORE-002` |
| NEW-1 | **Fixed immediately, not deferred.** The B-1 anchoring left `*.obj` unanchored one line above `*.lib`/`*.pdb`. `.obj` is both an MSVC object file and Wavefront OBJ, so `Source/Art/**/*.obj` and `Content/Raw/**/*.obj` were silently dropped — an original source mesh that never commits is an asset whose provenance cannot be demonstrated, while the author's clone looks fine. Anchored to `Intermediate/**` and `Binaries/**`; verified trackable at three source paths and still ignored at three build paths | closed in `CORE-001` |
| NEW-2 | Six anchored `*.pdb`/`*.lib` patterns cannot match — their parent directories are excluded wholesale and git does not descend into an excluded directory. Harmless, but a reader would think them load-bearing. Commented as belt-and-braces rather than deleted | closed in `CORE-001` |

**Reviewer's counterargument to approval, recorded because it is the real residual
risk.** The non-shipping guarantee is the ticket's most consequential deliverable, and
it is verified only for a Development Game target on one machine, resting on two
unenforced one-line invariants. If someone sets `bBuildRequiresCookedDataOverride =
false` or adds `RacingSimTests` to `RacingSim.Target.cs`, **no build fails and no test
fails.** Approval was given because the mechanism is verified in engine source and the
`.target` receipt corroborates it — but **`TEST-001` must add the automated check, or
this decays into a one-time manual result.**

**Decision owed at `CORE-002`, not inherited by default:** whether to keep
`PublicIncludePaths.Add(ModuleDirectory)` or restructure to `Public/`+`Private/`. The
reviewer would have chosen the split — the current fix publishes the whole module tree
to every dependent, leaving no way to mark a header private later without the
restructure that was avoided. Reversible at near-zero cost today; the cost rises with
every header, and `CORE-002` adds headers.

**Reviewer's assessment of the test itself, recorded rather than argued away.** The
genuine guarantee is that `RacingSimTests` links against and loads the runtime module
and that exported categories are reachable across a DLL boundary — which is exactly what
the `LNK2001` episode was about. But the count, distinctness and exact-name assertions
**cannot fail**: `LogCategory.h:123` derives the category name from the identifier via
`TEXT(#CategoryName)`, so a duplicate name is a duplicate-symbol link error rather than a
silent merge, and a rename is already a compile error in the spec file. The claim that
the test catches "distinctness and non-collision" overstates it. Not blocking — CORE-001
delivers no behaviour — but `TEST-001` should add assertions that can actually fail,
starting with whether the categories are registered with the log suppression system.

**Known consequence, accepted deliberately.** Boundaries between the five gameplay
layers are **not compile-enforced** under this layout. Nothing prevents `Streaming/`
from including a `Race/` header, and `CLAUDE.md` requires that no race truth lives in
`Streaming`. That rule is enforced by review here, not by the linker. If it is violated
in practice, promote the five layers to real modules — a mechanical change.

**Packaging note.** BLOCKER-006 was resolved in the same commit, so the package is
produced with the clean-stage path and `-stagingdirectory` outside `Documents\`.
`-nocleanstage` is no longer used and the stale-archive risk it carried is gone.

Nothing in the current stub obstructs this. `Source/RacingSim/RacingSim.Build.cs:14-23`
is minimal and correct, and both targets have current receipts.

`CORE-002` must define the units policy (Unreal centimetres, documented SI
conversions) and the build-ID scheme that `Docs/15-ProjectStructure.md` requires on
every competitive result. This closes the `Build ID/versioning method: UNVERIFIED`
field in `Docs/Environment.md`.

### CORE-002 — acceptance criteria, opened 2026-08-12

Scope per this row: `Settings, build ID, units, telemetry contracts`. Owner
`race-systems-engineer`. Gates A, B. Depends on `CORE-001` (DONE).

**Include-layout decision (project owner, 2026-08-12):** keep
`PublicIncludePaths.Add(ModuleDirectory)` from `CORE-001`. Do **not** restructure to
`Public/`+`Private/` in this ticket.

- [x] `Core/RacingSimSettings.h/.cpp` — `URacingSimSettings` (`UDeveloperSettings`,
      `config="Game"`), editable in Project Settings. This is the module's **first
      UObject**, so it is also the moment `N-3` (module-granularity finality) is tested
      for real rather than in the abstract.
- [x] Build ID scheme defined as a data contract (not populated with real track/car
      values yet — those land with `TRACK-001`/`VEH-003`) covering every field
      `Docs/15-ProjectStructure.md` "Versioning" section requires: game build ID, engine
      patch, track definition/version hash, car spec/tune version, physics policy
      version, assist preset, input type, validity/penalty state.
- [x] Units policy: Unreal-internal values stay centimetres; SI conversion constants/
      functions (cm↔m, cm/s↔km/h or m/s as needed) live in `Core/` with unit tests.
      Every conversion site documents cm vs SI in a comment per `CLAUDE.md`.
- [x] `Core/RacingTelemetry.h/.cpp` — shared telemetry data-contract structs consumed by
      `Vehicle`/`Race`/`UI`/`Streaming`. Contracts only, no gameplay logic, matching
      `Core`'s architecture role (`CLAUDE.md` Architecture boundaries).
- [x] `N-1` closed: `RacingSimLog.h`'s `CompileTimeVerbosity` third parameter and its
      comment are corrected to match the mechanism actually verified in
      `LogMacros.h`/`LogVerbosity.h` — not asserted from memory. Current code claims
      Verbose/VeryVerbose compile out of Shipping; the parameter as written (`All`)
      does not do that.
- [x] `N-3` closed: record here that the two-module decision
      (`Docs/15-ProjectStructure.md`, 2026-08-12) is now exercised by a real UObject and
      stands as final — no further deferral.
- [x] `N-6` closed: `Docs/15-ProjectStructure.md`'s `RacingSimTests/` tree adds `Core/`
      (already present on disk at `Source/RacingSimTests/Core/RacingSimLogSpec.cpp`).
- [x] `N-7` closed: `.gitignore` re-scoped so the `Samples/PixelStreaming2/WebServers/`
      rationale comment (lines 80-84) no longer visually reads as covering the unrelated
      `Archive/`/`StagedBuilds/` lines beneath it.
- [x] Editor **and** Game targets build with zero new warnings — `Result: Succeeded`
      plus filtered `warning|error` output inspected for both, closing the Game-target
      gap CORE-001 left open.
- [x] `RacingSimTests` gains automation coverage for unit-conversion correctness and
      settings default values.
- [x] `Docs/Environment.md`'s `Build ID/versioning method: UNVERIFIED` field is closed
      with the implemented scheme.

### CORE-002 — verification evidence, 2026-08-13

- Editor (`RacingSimEditor Win64 Development`): `Result: Succeeded`, 0 `warning|error`
  matches in the filtered UBT log.
- Game (`RacingSim Win64 Development`): `Result: Succeeded`, 0 `warning|error` matches
  in the filtered UBT log.
- Automation `Smoke` filter, this worktree: `Saved/Automation/Report/index.json` —
  `succeeded: 432, failed: 0, notRun: 0`.
- `code-reviewer` pass 1: 2 HIGH, 8 MEDIUM, 7 LOW. Verdict "changes requested, no
  blockers." Independently verified the build/test evidence above rather than trusting
  the report.

### CORE-002 — review findings, pass 1

| ID | Finding | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H-1 | `IsPublishable()` did not check `bIsAuthoritative`; a complete-but-Derived stamp would pass | Fixed — `IsPublishable()` now rejects a non-authoritative `GameBuildId`; test added (`RacingSimVersionSpec.cpp`) |
| H-2 | `SanitiseComponent` can silently mutate a stamped Explicit ID (e.g. `"1.4.0+4417"`, `"feature/x"`), losing traceability while still marked authoritative | Fixed — `Current()` now warns with both raw and sanitised values when they differ; still authoritative (CI's responsibility to supply a clean stamp, now surfaced loudly); tests added for `+` and `/` cases |
| M-1 | `RacingSimSettings.h` comment falsely claimed `-`/`+` are stripped from a derived ID | Fixed — comment corrected; derived ID declared opaque/never-parsed; hyphenated-channel test added |
| M-2 | `TelemetryStaleAfterSeconds = 0` disables staleness checking on a comment citing a convention documented on a different field | Fixed — "0 disables" documented on the field itself in `RacingSimSettings.h`, with a warning against leaving it there in a built config |
| M-3 | `USTRUCT(BlueprintType)` contracts (telemetry conversions, `ToString()`, `IsStaleAt`, etc.) have no `UFUNCTION`-callable equivalents, so Blueprint/UMG cannot actually reach them despite the HUD being UMG per `CLAUDE.md` | **Deferred to `UI-001`** — needs a `URacingTelemetryFunctionLibrary` with `BlueprintPure` wrappers; out of scope for a Core-only contract ticket |
| M-4 | `FRacingTelemetryFrame` embeds `TArray`-bearing structs, so copying "the one frame the HUD may read" heap-allocates; `CLAUDE.md` forbids per-frame allocation | **Deferred to `UI-001`** alongside M-3 — needs either a documented pass-by-`const&` contract or a `TInlineAllocator` |
| M-5 | `ClampMin`/`ClampMax` metadata is not enforced on `-ini:` config overrides or on `BlueprintReadOnly`-only telemetry fields | **Deferred to `CORE-003`** (DataAsset/config validation framework) — the natural home for a `PostInitProperties` range-clamp pass |
| M-6 | `Docs/15-ProjectStructure.md` still said "splitting later is a mechanical change" after `N-3` should have closed that claim | Fixed — finality recorded in the document itself, not only in a C++ comment |
| M-7 | Game-target build evidence predated the final source revision | Fixed — both targets rebuilt at the final revision (see verification evidence above) |
| M-8 | `Docs/Environment.md`'s build-ID description was inaccurate (claimed 2 components from `FEngineVersion`/`FApp`; actually 5, one of which reads `GConfig`) | Fixed — description rewritten to the actual 5-component format with the `GetProjectVersion()` `0.0.0`-fallback caveat noted |
| L-1..L-5, L-7 | Comment/trait/NaN/log-cadence nits | **Batched forward** — reviewer confirmed not required for re-review |
| L-6 | This acceptance-criteria block existed only on `main`, uncommitted, absent from this branch | Fixed by this edit |

### CORE-002 — review findings, pass 2 (re-review)

Verdict: **approved for merge**, conditional on the three items below — no further review
cycle required once applied. Confirmed the M-3/M-4/M-5 deferrals to `UI-001`/`CORE-003`
(M-4 partially — see below). Independently re-verified all pass-1 fixes against the
post-fix worktree, including a rebuild at the exact final revision.

| ID | Finding | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MEDIUM-1 | H-2's fix still marks a sanitisation-mutated Explicit ID `bIsAuthoritative = true`, despite the fix's own comment stating this breaks CI traceability and uniqueness | **Batched forward to `CORE-003`** (see below) — no production caller of `IsPublishable` exists yet; tracked rather than fixed blind |
| MEDIUM-2 | `SanitiseComponent` rejects `+`, but the Derived-scheme composer embeds a literal `+` itself (engine changelist separator) — inconsistent, and the H-2 warning fires on every standard semver-style CI stamp (`1.4.0+4417`) | **Batched forward to `CORE-003`** alongside MEDIUM-1 |
| MEDIUM-3 | The two H-2 tests registered the identical `AddExpectedMessagePlain` pattern string; `TSet`-keyed dedup makes the second registration silently replace the first, so the test passes even if only one case actually warns | **Fixed** — patterns now include the raw stamped value (`"...stamped \"1.4.0+4417\""` / `"...stamped \"feature/x\""`), making them distinct and provably tied to the right input |
| MEDIUM-4 | M-3/M-4/M-5 dispositions lived only in this ticket's closed history, not in the receiving tickets' own bodies | **Fixed** — see `### CORE-003 — findings inherited from CORE-002` and `### UI-001 — findings inherited from CORE-002` below |
| MEDIUM-5 | `RacingSimLog.h`'s Shipping/Test `CompileTimeVerbosity = Log` branch has no compile evidence (only Development built) | **Batched forward** — engine's own `static_assert` (`LogCategory.h:121-122`) is satisfied by inspection; no Shipping/Test config exists yet for this project |
| LOW-1..LOW-3 | Doc-comment/asymmetry nits | **Batched forward** |
| LOW-4 | Entire CORE-002 change set was uncommitted at review time — no revision to pin evidence to | **Fixed** — committed before dispatching `test-engineer` (see commit referenced in the completion report) |

**Deferred review findings CORE-001 must also close — ALL FOUR CLOSED 2026-08-12.**

Raised by `code-reviewer` against the Phase 0 shell on 2026-08-10, deferred as
over-exclusions on a stub. A second `code-reviewer` pass at `3bbd9ca` correctly blocked
CORE-001 for leaving this block open while the status line read "all 8 criteria
evidenced" — the checkboxes were done, the ticket as written was not.

Closure verified by `git check-ignore` with both controls, so the test discriminates:

- **still ignored** (6/6): `Binaries/Win64/UnrealEditor-RacingSim.pdb`, the matching
  `.lib`, `Build/Windows/FileOpenOrder/CookerOpenOrder.log`, `Saved/Logs/*.log`,
  `Packaged/Windows/RacingSim.exe`, root `CMakeLists.txt`
- **now trackable** (6/6, previously dropped): `Build/Windows/Resources/Icon.ico`,
  `Build/Windows/Application.manifest`, `Build/Windows/PakBlacklist-Shipping.txt`,
  `Source/ThirdParty/Foo/x64/foo.lib`, `Source/ThirdParty/Foo/CMakeLists.txt`,
  `Source/ThirdParty/Foo/Makefile`

The original findings, retained for the record:

- `.gitignore:3` — bare `Build/` ignores the whole Unreal `Build/` tree at any
  depth, which will silently drop files that must be tracked later:
  `Build/Windows/Resources/*.ico`, `Application.manifest`, `Build/*/PakBlacklist*.txt`.
  Switch to Epic's pattern: `Build/*` plus `!Build/*/` and explicit un-ignores.
- `.gitignore:37` — `*.lib` and `*.pdb` are ignored at any depth while
  `.gitattributes` LFS-tracks `*.dll`/`*.so`. A future
  `Source/ThirdParty/**/x64/*.lib` would be dropped while its sibling DLL commits.
  Anchor the artifact ignores to generated locations.
- `.gitignore:27-29` — `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `compile_commands.json`
  ignored at any depth; would drop a legitimate vendored third-party
  `CMakeLists.txt`. Anchor to repo root.
- `Config/DefaultGame.ini` — the `bShould*` / `bOnlyCookProductionAssets` values
  restate engine defaults (`AssetManagerSettings.h:73-76`), adding drift risk with
  no behavioural change. Already removed in Phase 0; do not reintroduce.

### CORE-003 — acceptance criteria, opened 2026-08-14

Scope per this row: `DataAsset validation framework`. Owner `race-systems-engineer`.
Gate A. Depends on `CORE-002` (DONE). Read "### CORE-003 — findings inherited from
CORE-002" immediately below **first** — it names two concrete defects this ticket
must close, not just a framework to build in the abstract.

- [ ] A reusable, reflection-driven validation pass that re-applies a `UPROPERTY`'s
      `ClampMin`/`ClampMax` metadata after config/ini load — closing the gap that
      metadata only constrains the Details panel today, not an
      `-ini:Game:[...]:Field=value` override.
- [ ] `URacingSimSettings` calls this pass (e.g. from a config-load hook) so an
      out-of-range ini value (`TelemetrySampleRateHz=1e6`, negative
      `PhysicsPolicyVersion`, etc.) is clamped or rejected rather than loading
      unchallenged.
- [ ] `URaceRulesetDataAsset::Validate()` (RACE-001) is evaluated for reuse under this
      same framework rather than staying a one-off pattern — either adopt it as the
      framework's shape, or state in this ticket why it stays separate.
- [ ] M-5 (pass 1, CORE-002) closed — see the inherited-findings table below.
- [ ] MEDIUM-1 (pass 2, CORE-002) closed: `FRacingSimBuildId::Current()`'s Explicit
      branch stops marking a sanitisation-mutated stamp `bIsAuthoritative = true`;
      adopt the same rule already used one branch below in the same function for the
      empty-stamp case (`Result.bIsAuthoritative = (Stamped == Trimmed)`).
- [ ] MEDIUM-2 (pass 2, CORE-002) closed: either add `+` to `SanitiseComponent`'s
      allow-list, or document explicitly why Derived may embed `+` and Explicit may
      not.
- [ ] `RacingSimTests` gains automation coverage: an out-of-range ini value is
      clamped/rejected for at least two distinct properties, plus tests for both
      MEDIUM-1 and MEDIUM-2's fixed behavior.
- [ ] Editor **and** Game targets build with zero new warnings.

### CORE-003 — findings inherited from CORE-002

Raised by `code-reviewer` against CORE-002 (`Source/RacingSim/Core/RacingSimSettings.h`,
`RacingSimBuildId.cpp`, `RacingTelemetry.cpp`), deferred here because CORE-003 (this
ticket) is the DataAsset/config validation framework and these are all "unenforced range
or invariant" problems, not contract-shape problems. Read before writing CORE-003's
acceptance criteria — do not rediscover these from scratch:

| ID | Finding | What CORE-003 must do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M-5 (pass 1) | `ClampMin`/`ClampMax` metadata on `URacingSimSettings` properties (e.g. `TelemetrySampleRateHz`, `PhysicsPolicyVersion`) is enforced only in the details panel, not on `-ini:Game:...=` config overrides. `LapTimeFractionalDigits=99`, `TelemetrySampleRateHz=1e6`, or a negative `PhysicsPolicyVersion` load unchallenged from an ini | Add a `PostInitProperties`/config-load validation pass that re-applies the same range constraints the `UPROPERTY` metadata declares, and a test that an out-of-range ini value is clamped or rejected |
| MEDIUM-1 (pass 2) | `FRacingSimBuildId::Current()` (`RacingSimBuildId.cpp`, Explicit-scheme branch) marks a sanitisation-mutated stamped ID `bIsAuthoritative = true` even though the fix's own comment states this breaks CI traceability and the uniqueness guarantee that `bIsAuthoritative` promises | Decide and implement the safer rule already used one branch below in the same function for the empty-stamp case: `Result.bIsAuthoritative = (Stamped == Trimmed);` — i.e. a mutated stamp is not authoritative |
| MEDIUM-2 (pass 2) | `SanitiseComponent`'s allow-list rejects `+`, but the Derived-scheme ID composer embeds a literal `+` itself (`RacingSimBuildId.cpp`, changelist separator) — inconsistent, and it means the H-2 warning fires on every conventionally-formatted CI stamp (semver build metadata, `1.4.0+4417`) | Either add `+` to the allow-list, or document explicitly why Derived may use `+` and Explicit may not |

## Epic 2 — vehicle graybox

| ID | Title | Owner | Depends on | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VEH-001 | Keyboard/gamepad input mappings | vehicle-physics-engineer | CORE-001 | B | OPEN |
| VEH-002 | Prototype chassis/wheels/collision, Chaos baseline | vehicle-physics-engineer | VEH-001 | C | OPEN |
| VEH-003 | Engine/transmission/diff/brakes/steering/suspension tune data | vehicle-physics-engineer | VEH-002, CORE-003 | C | OPEN |
| VEH-004 | Telemetry and failure detection | vehicle-physics-engineer | VEH-002 | C | OPEN |
| VEH-005 | Camera and safe reset | vehicle-physics-engineer | VEH-002 | B, C | OPEN |
| VEH-006 | Recorded manoeuvre tests and 30-minute soak | test-engineer + implementer | VEH-003..005 | C | OPEN |

Chaos Vehicles is mandatory (hard constraint #2). No Unity-style WheelCollider
architecture. Tunables live in typed DataAssets, never as magic numbers in `Tick`.

`VEH-004` must detect NaN, infinity, explosive energy, persistent penetration and
unbounded wheel state — Gate C treats these as test failures, not warnings.

---

## Epic 3 — track and race

| ID | Title | Owner | Depends on | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TRACK-001 | Original circuit graybox and spline centerline | race-systems-engineer | CORE-001 | B | OPEN |
| TRACK-002 | Ordered checkpoint gates and crossing direction | race-systems-engineer | TRACK-001 | B | OPEN |
| RACE-001 | Race state machine and monotonic clock | race-systems-engineer | CORE-002 | B | OPEN |
| RACE-002 | Lap/sector/progress/validity logic | race-systems-engineer | TRACK-002, RACE-001 | B | OPEN |
| RACE-003 | Results, restart, metadata | race-systems-engineer | RACE-002 | B | OPEN |
| RACE-004 | Shortcut/reverse/double-trigger/reset automation matrix | test-engineer + implementer | RACE-003 | B | OPEN |

Gate B is unusually explicit and these tickets inherit it verbatim: 100 automated
valid laps count exactly once; 100 skipped/out-of-order/reverse/double-cross
scenarios never produce a valid lap; the timer is monotonic and independent of
render frame rate; reset can never award progress or duplicate a checkpoint.

The circuit must be **original**. No real track name, layout, signage or venue.

### RACE-001 — acceptance criteria, opened 2026-08-13

Scope per this row: `Race state machine and monotonic clock`. Owner
`race-systems-engineer`. Gate B. Depends on `CORE-002` (DONE).

**Deliberately track-agnostic.** `TRACK-001`/`TRACK-002` (checkpoints, centerline) and
lap/sector validation (`RACE-002`) are later, separate tickets. RACE-001 is the state
machine skeleton and the clock everything else attaches to — it must not reference a
checkpoint, a lap, or a track asset.

- [ ] Race state enum (e.g. `ERaceState`: PreRace, Countdown, Racing, Finished, Results)
      lives in `Core/RacingSimTypes.h` alongside the project's other shared vocabulary
      (`ERacingRunValidity`, `ERacingInputDeviceType`) — `UI/` needs to read it for the
      HUD later without depending on `Race/`.
- [ ] The state machine itself (transition logic, clock ownership) lives in `Race/`, not
      `Core/` — it is race truth, not a shared contract. `CLAUDE.md`: "No race truth
      lives in `Streaming`" implies the inverse too — race truth lives in `Race/`.
- [ ] Only the authored transition graph is legal (e.g. PreRace→Countdown→Racing→
      Finished→Results, Results→PreRace on restart). An illegal transition attempt is
      rejected and logged, never silently applied and never a crash.
- [ ] Countdown, start, finish, results, and restart transitions are deterministic and
      idempotent — calling the same transition twice produces no additional effect
      (Gate B, verbatim).
- [ ] Race clock is monotonic and independent of render frame rate (Gate B, verbatim):
      elapsed time is derived from a monotonic time source (e.g. `FPlatformTime::Seconds()`),
      not accumulated from per-tick `DeltaTime`, so it cannot drift under frame-rate
      variance or a paused/hitched frame.
- [ ] Clock is a single server-side authority — nothing client-side interpolates or
      guesses race time; this is the source `RACE-002` will time laps against.
- [ ] Restart/reset can never award progress: restarting mid-race returns the state
      machine to `PreRace`/`Countdown` with the clock re-zeroed, never to a state that
      preserves partial progress (Gate B, verbatim — the checkpoint half of this rule is
      `RACE-002`'s, the state/clock half is this ticket's).
- [ ] No per-frame allocations, no broad actor searches, no synchronous asset loads in
      the state machine's `Tick` or transition paths (`CLAUDE.md` coding rules).
- [ ] `RacingSimTests` gains automation coverage: every legal transition, every illegal
      transition attempt (rejected, not crashed), idempotency of each transition called
      twice, and clock monotonicity under a simulated variable/dropped frame rate.
- [ ] Editor **and** Game targets build with zero new warnings.

### TRACK-001 — acceptance criteria, opened 2026-08-14

Scope per this row: `Original circuit graybox and spline centerline`. Owner
`race-systems-engineer`. Gate B. Depends on `CORE-001` (DONE). **Original circuit
only** — no real track name, layout, signage, or venue (`CLAUDE.md` non-negotiable
decisions; `LEGAL-001`'s ledger governs any external reference art).

**Deliberately checkpoint-agnostic**, mirroring RACE-001's split: ordered checkpoint
gates and crossing-direction validation are `TRACK-002`, not this ticket. TRACK-001 is
the centerline/track-identity contract everything else attaches to.

- [ ] `ATrackDefinitionActor` (`Source/RacingSim/Race/`, per `Docs/01-Architecture.md`'s
      proposed types) exposes: centerline spline (closed loop), track length in
      centimetres (with a documented cm→SI conversion, per `CLAUDE.md` units rule and
      `RacingSimUnits.h`'s existing conversion policy), sector boundary markers along
      the spline, start/finish transform, grid slot transforms, and reset sample points
      (nearest-valid-track-point candidates for `VEH-005`'s safe reset, later).
- [ ] Spline-distance and nearest-point queries are exposed as a typed, testable API
      (not raw `USplineComponent` calls scattered across callers) — this is the surface
      `RACE-002`'s progress/lap logic and `VEH-005`'s reset will consume.
- [ ] Track identity uses `FRacingContentVersion` (`CORE-002`, `RacingSimBuildId.h`) —
      `GetContentVersion()`/content-hash pattern, matching `URaceRulesetDataAsset`'s
      precedent from `RACE-001` — so `FRacingSimVersionStamp::TrackVersion` (reserved by
      CORE-002) can be populated from a real asset instead of staying empty.
- [ ] A minimal graybox test level (`Content/Tracks/Prototype/Maps/`, per
      `Docs/15-ProjectStructure.md`'s planned tree) containing one closed-loop
      `ATrackDefinitionActor` instance, using only primitive/placeholder geometry — no
      final art, no license-ledger-requiring external asset. Sufficient for `TRACK-002`
      and `RACE-002`'s automation to exercise real checkpoint/lap logic against.
- [ ] `RacingSimTests` gains automation coverage for the centerline/spline-query API
      (distance along spline, nearest point, sector boundaries) that does **not**
      require the test map — testable against a procedurally-constructed spline in a
      transient world/commandlet, matching RACE-001's testability-first design so the
      cheap, certain work doesn't block on the level-authoring step.
- [ ] Editor **and** Game targets build with zero new warnings.

## Epic 4 — HUD

| ID | Title | Owner | Depends on | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| UI-001 | HUD view model and data contract | race-systems-engineer | RACE-003 | B | OPEN |
| UI-002 | Speed/RPM/gear/lap/time/delta/countdown/results | race-systems-engineer | UI-001 | B | OPEN |
| UI-003 | Input prompts, settings, restart flow, accessibility baseline | race-systems-engineer | UI-002 | B | OPEN |
| UI-004 | HUD functional and screenshot tests | test-engineer + implementer | UI-003 | B, D | OPEN |

HUD reads authoritative race state; it never computes race truth. Position is shown
only when opponents exist. Text must stay readable at the lowest supported stream
tier — a Pixel Streaming constraint, not a normal UI one.

### UI-001 — findings inherited from CORE-002

Raised by `code-reviewer` against CORE-002 (`Source/RacingSim/Core/RacingTelemetry.h`,
`RacingSimUnits.h`), deferred here because no Blueprint/UMG consumer existed yet at
CORE-002 to validate the wrapper shape against. Read before writing UI-001's acceptance
criteria:

| ID | Finding | What UI-001 must do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M-3 (pass 1) | `RacingTelemetry.h`/`RacingSimUnits.h` structs are `USTRUCT(BlueprintType)` but their member functions (`GetForwardSpeedKph/Mph/MetresPerSecond`, `IsStaleAt`, `AreSectorsConsistent`, `IsComplete`, `IsPopulated`, `ToString`, unit conversions) are plain C++ — a `USTRUCT` member function cannot be a `UFUNCTION`, so none of this is reachable from Blueprint/UMG despite the HUD being UMG per `CLAUDE.md` | Add a `URacingTelemetryFunctionLibrary` with `BlueprintPure` wrappers. Keep it in `Source/RacingSim/Core/` even though this ticket owns the work — it wraps *Core* contracts (unit conversions, staleness), and putting it in `UI/` would give CORE-002's unit-conversion policy a second home |
| M-4 (pass 1) | `FRacingTelemetryFrame` (`RacingTelemetry.h`) embeds two `FRacingLapTiming`, each carrying a `TArray<double> SectorDurationsSeconds` — copying "the single frame the HUD is allowed to read" heap-allocates twice per copy, and `CLAUDE.md` forbids per-frame allocation | Either document that frames are passed by `const&` and never copied per tick, or replace the `TArray` with a `TArray<double, TInlineAllocator<N>>` sized to the real sector count once track data exists |

## Epic 5 — Pixel Streaming

| ID | Title | Owner | Depends on | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| STREAM-001 | Local packaged PS2 connection | pixel-streaming-engineer | ENV-004, UI-002 | F | OPEN |
| STREAM-002 | Browser frontend shell, versioned custom messages | pixel-streaming-engineer | STREAM-001 | F, G | OPEN |
| STREAM-003 | Gamepad/focus/reconnect tests | test-engineer + implementer | STREAM-002 | F | OPEN |
| STREAM-004 | External STUN/TURN test | pixel-streaming-engineer | STREAM-002 | F | **BLOCKED** — BLOCKER-001 |
| STREAM-005 | Session broker/worker lifecycle spike | pixel-streaming-engineer | STREAM-002 | G | **BLOCKED** — BLOCKER-001 |
| STREAM-006 | WebRTC telemetry and latency measurement | performance-engineer | STREAM-002 | E, F | **BLOCKED** — BLOCKER-001 |

`STREAM-001` through `STREAM-003` are provable locally: connection, input routing,
reconnect, session telemetry. **Latency and quality targets are not** — Gate F
thresholds are regional measurements requiring the reference worker (ADR-0003).

Custom messages are versioned, size-limited, validated, authenticated by session
context, and never authoritative over race state.

---

## Epic 6 — visual vertical slice

**Entire epic BLOCKED on BLOCKER-001** (no reference GPU worker). Per ADR-0003,
starting hero-quality art without a measurement baseline risks producing content
that cannot be validated and may need rebuilding.

`ART-001` hero car source and provenance · `ART-002` car material family and
turntable benchmark · `ART-003` hero circuit sector and environment materials ·
`ART-004` lighting/post/camera benchmark · `ART-005` audio vertical slice ·
`PERF-001` reference trace, budgets, optimization · `VIS-001` screenshot baseline
and human art gate.

Owners: `rendering-tech-artist`, with `performance-engineer` at PERF-001 and
`ip-compliance-auditor` gating ART-001. Gates D, E, H.

`ART-001` cannot start until the generative-AI provenance question in
`Docs/13-AssetLicenseLedger.md` is answered by the legal owner.

---

## Epic 7 — hardening and deployment

**Blocked on BLOCKER-001.** `OPS-001` worker image · `OPS-002` auth, rate limit,
timeout, cost guardrails · `OPS-003` metrics/logs/crashes/alerts · `OPS-004`
100-cycle session test · `SEC-001` exposure and secret audit · `REL-001` full
A–H gate report and rollback drill.

`SEC-001` must confirm Unreal MCP is unreachable on production workers, and should
also account for `UbaServer` binding `0.0.0.0:1345` during builds (NOTE-001) —
build-time only, but it belongs in the exposure audit.

## Milestone gates

| Milestone | Contents | Gates | Human approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 Phase 0 | Epic 0 | A (partial) | **Required before Epic 1** |
| M1 Graybox | Epics 1–4 | A, B, C | Required |
| M2 Local streaming | Epic 5 (001–003) | F (partial) | Required |
| M3 Visual slice | Epic 6 | D, E | Required — art director |
| M4 Release readiness | Epic 7 | A–H | Required — legal + ops + art |

`production-ready` may not appear in any report before M4, per
`Docs/07-QualityGates.md`.

## Critical path

`ENV-004` → `CORE-001` → `CORE-002` → `RACE-001` → `TRACK-001` → `TRACK-002` →
`RACE-002` → `RACE-003` → `UI-001` → `UI-002` → `STREAM-001`

Vehicle work (Epic 2) parallelises with track work (Epic 3) after `CORE-002`,
provided the two owners do not touch the same content assets — which, given
BLOCKER-002, is a process guarantee rather than a tooling one.
